### E-commerce Data Analysis for Product Purchase Prediction
This project involves analyzing a dataset comprising over 10,000 entries with 17 different features.
The primary objective is to make a supervised prediction on whether a product will be bought based on the amount of time spent on the website. 

##### Overview

To analyze the dataset, various algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Decision Trees were used. These algorithms were implemented both directly from the scikit-learn library and manually for better understanding.
A comprehensive evaluation was conducted at the end to assess the performance of the models.


##### Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the sequential steps undertaken in the development and analysis of the e-commerce product purchase prediction project. 
Each phase is important for progressing towards the ultimate goal of building accurate predictive models by following a structured approach to data analysis, model implementation, evaluation, and documentation. 

1. **Data Visualization and Curation**
   - Perform initial exploration of the dataset. Note that data can be both numerical and categorigal so specific procedures must be followed
   - Visualize key features and distributions to gain insights using barplots / countplots.
   - Preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Model Selection and Implementation**
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for prediction (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
   - Implement selected models using both scikit-learn library and manual implementations.
   
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Train the models on the preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

4. **Comparison and Analysis**
   - Compare the performance of models implemented using scikit-learn and manual implementations.
   - Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
   - Determine the most effective model for predicting product purchases.
